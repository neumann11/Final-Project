I wanted to create a bot that could be remotely controlled and have full mobility, with applications in cleaning and space exploration. The biggest challenge was the limited resources; this forced me to get creative in some areas. I began with the design, then moved on to Blender, and then to the legs. I soon realized I needed something called an H-bridge to control the motors, which I didn't have. So, I decided to build an H-bridge using transistors, which I also lacked. I looked around and thought about what devices might contain transistors. I found a radio that, to my surprise, had a battery-to-wire connector that was very useful. However, I didn't find a transistor, so I opted for a different mechanism for movement.

I assembled the body and started on the electronics. I also needed a breadboard to manage my electronics, which I didn't have, so I decided to build my own using copper wires and some cardboard. However, I found that just soldering the wires was better, so I discarded the homemade board. At this point, I stopped building the bot and started learning how to work with Raspberry Pis. I installed the OS and learned about the Linux system, which was very interesting. Then, I went on to connect a camera to my Pi. While I was removing a cable because I attached the wrong end, I made the significant mistake of pulling too hard, which resulted in cutting the wire. I panicked; all I had at that point was a bot that could move forward. It felt like everything that could go wrong did go wrong, and I deeply regretted not building a Discord bot instead. I called it a day.

So, I looked around my room and found LED lights I had bought long ago for decoration. The lights came with a remote, and I was curious if I could use the remote for my project. I Googled and found that I could use the Arduino I had. I attached the receiver and lights to my bot, thinking this could add a nice touch. The final product was nothing like I expected. It broke half of the time. But, I learned a lot during this short period about microprocessors, Linux, and electronics.
