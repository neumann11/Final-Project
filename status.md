Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

- I researched everything needed for my project, including mechanical and electrical parts.
- I drew a blueprint showing what the bot will look like.
- I made a 3D model in Blender to see how the bot will look.
- I bought all the electronic parts needed for my project.
- I started putting together most of the electronics.


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

- Build the body of the bot.
- Connect all parts.
- Do testing.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

When researching, I realized that making the bot walk might be too hard with the limited resources and time I have, so I decided to try a different approach than I originally planned.
