# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

RoboAnt

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A robotic ant that can be remotely controlled and equipped with a camera to explore its surroundings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The RoboAnt will be designed to navigate various environments under remote control. It will feature a small camera, allowing it to capture video and interact with its environment intelligently. The primary goal is to create a robot that's both mobile and aware, offering a unique perspective on robotics at a micro scale.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Remote control functionality.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Incorporating camera-based environment detection.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Image detection using classifier.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My initial steps involve researching Raspberry Pis for camera integration and selecting a suitable microcontroller, likely an Arduino Nano or Uno. I plan to sketch my design before creating a CAD model to visualize its structure. After determining the specific electronics required, I will buy the needed parts, print the model, and then focus on programming the robot and assembling all components for final testing.
